### Description: 
I focus on JavaScript Local & Global scope. The main goal was to get an understanding of how the scope works within the function and how it works outside the function.

### Prerequisites:
- Any Modern Browser (Preferably Chrome or Firefox)
- Any IDE to view code (Preferably VS Code or Brackets)
- Access to developer tools on web browser

### Instructions:
- Step 1: Load Up IDE (If you don't have one use this: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- Step 2: Clone project or download from GitHub
- Step 3: Load up project in IDE
- Step 4: Right click on the .html file and click Live Server
- Step 5: Load up developer tools on browser
- Step 6: Access browser console

### What I learned:
- Local Scope within a function
- Global Scope outside a function

### Constraints:
I was learning so I didn't have any problems
